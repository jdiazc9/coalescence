Microbial communities often invade one another, for instance, terrestrial microbiomes mix with aquatic microorganisms in riverine courses and gut microbiomes invade external communities through the secretions of the host animal. This phenomenon is known as community coalescence. Despite its potential importance for the assembly of natural communities and prospective utilty as a microbiome engineering tool, the rules that govern it are still poorly understood. In this work, we use a combination of experiments and mathematical modeling to show that cross-feeding interactions among community members can produce correlated invasional outcomes where species recruit one another into the final coalesced community. Our results provide insights into the determinants of coalescence outcomes in synthetic laboratory conditions, and bring new tools to investigate the mechanisms of coalescence in different ecological settings.
